# tf2-shiny-pvp-configs

Version controlled server configs for Shiny Squad's TF2 PVP server.

This repository contains all human influenced changes on the Shiny Squad TF2 PVP server. 
We should be able to take a clean TF2 server, run every command in `changelog.txt`, 
overlay the repository like a filesystem on top of our server, and come out with a
perfectly configured server.

## Development

* Anytime you make a human change via FTP on the server, replicate the change here.

* Some Sourcemod plugins may generate config files - check these in too! Check especially
the `tf/addons/sourcemod/configs` and `tf/cfg/sourcemod` directories.
